                <p>This project aims to develop a dog health care system that will allow dog owners to easily manage
                    their
                    dog's health care needs. The system will provide features like booking appointments with
                    veterinarians
                    and groomers, purchasing pet products, and accessing a range of health care resources. The project
                    will
                    be developed as a web-based application with a user-friendly interface and a database to store user
                    and
                    dog data. The project will be divided into three phases, including the development of the
                    appointment
                    booking system and database, the development of the pet e-commerce platform and health care resource
                    library, and testing and deployment of the complete system. Overall, this project aims to provide a
                    comprehensive solution for managing the health care needs of dogs and improving the overall
                    experience
                    for dog owners</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p> The system will include an appointment booking system that allows dog owners to schedule
                    appointments with veterinarians and groomers in a seamless and efficient manner. The system will
                    include a pet e-commerce platform that provides a range of pet products and supplies, including
                    food, toys, leashes, and collars. The platform will allow users to purchase products and have them
                    delivered to their doorstep.The system will include a health care resource library that provides
                    information on pet health care and Nutrition. The system will include user profiles where dog owners
                    can store information about their pets, including their medical history, vaccination records, and
                    grooming preferences. This information will be securely stored in a database and can be accessed by
                    the user whenever they need it. The proposed system for the dog health care project will provide a
                    comprehensive solution for managing the health care needs of dogs and will improve the overall
