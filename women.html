                    <li>Global Statistics</li>
                    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced
                        physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.
                        UN Women reports that 70% of women globally have experienced some form of violence or harassment
                        in public spaces.</p>
                    <li>Gender-Based Violence</li>
                    <p>In the United States, 1 in 4 women (25%) have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate
                        partner, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
                        The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that 137 women are killed by a family
                        member every day around the world.</p>
                    <li>Sexual Harassment</li>
                    <p>A global survey by ActionAid found that 79% of women in cities around the world have experienced
                        sexual harassment or violence in public spaces.
                        In India, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reported an 87% increase in reported cases of
                        sexual harassment in public spaces between 2018 and 2020.</p>
                    <li>Intersectional Challenges</li>
                    <p>Women from marginalized communities face intersecting forms of discrimination and violence. For
                        example, indigenous women in Canada are three times more likely to experience violence than
                        non-indigenous women, according to Statistics Canada.
                        LGBTQ+ individuals, especially transgender women of color, face heightened risks of violence and
                        harassment. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) reported that 44% of hate
                        violence homicide victims in the United States in 2020 were transgender women of color.</p>

<div class="headings">
    <p>The Women Safe App, with its array of features like Emergency SOS, Spy 
        Camera Detector, Women's News, Siren, App Tour, and Add Complaint, has 
        the potential for continued growth and development.And as well Retriving the 
        live location of the person who is in trouble is the biggest future Enhancement 
        The app could be integrated with smartwatches and other wearable devices to 
        provide even quicker access to emergency services. Wearables could also 
        monitor the user's well-being and send alerts if unusual or distressing situations 
        are detected. 
        Expanding the app to include a community forum or chat feature would enable 
        users to connect, share experiences, and provide emotional support. This could 
        create a sense of solidarity among users, fostering a supportive environment. 
        Introducing a section with resources and educational materials on self-defense, 
        safety tips, and legal rights for women could empower users with knowledge 
        and skills to protect themselves. 
        Collaborating with law enforcement agencies to streamline the process of 
        reporting incidents and receiving help through the app can be beneficial. This 
        would require careful consideration of privacy and data security. 
        Expanding the app to include resources related to mental health and wellness 
        can support users in coping with the psychological impacts of unsafe situations.</p>
